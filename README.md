## Info
All of my custom scripts can be found on the `.local/bin/` folder in the home directory *(for more see cbox)* . The current layout is as follows:

| Folder     | Description                                                                                  |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bar/`     | status bar main script + themes                                                              |
| `cron/`    | As its name says, all of my cron jobs scripts<br>*(e.g backup stuff, updates)*               |
| `system/`  | Mostly scripts used for init purposes by the <br> window manager, the status bar, zsh & cbox |
| `helpers/` | Keybinded scripts, polybar modules other helpful stuff                                                                                             |
